Rector for TYPO3
================

Rector for TYPO3 was created to help developers upgrade their TYPO3 installations
and ensure their extensions support the latest versions of PHP and TYPO3. Rector
scans your code base and replaces any deprecated functions with an appropriate
replacement. Rector can also help ensure better code quality by means of automated refactoring.

Rector can run as a standalone package or it can be integrated with your CI pipeline.
