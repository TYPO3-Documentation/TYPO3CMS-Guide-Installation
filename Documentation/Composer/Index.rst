Working With Composer
=====================

This chapter includes a number of helpful commands and best practices for
using TYPO3 with Composer.

Run Composer Locally
====================

You should not run `composer` on your live webspace. You should always run
`composer` on your local or a dedicated deployment machine, so you can test
if everything worked
fine. After running your tests, you can deploy the :file:`vendor` and
:file:`public` folder to your web server.

To avoid conflicts between your local and your server's PHP version and PHP extensions, you
can use a Composer `platform definition <https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#platform>`__.

Update Packages
===============

After updating any packages, you always should commit your
:file:`composer.lock` to your version control system and your co-workers
should run `composer install` after checking out the updates.

Update all Packages
-------------------

Run `composer update` without any other attributes, to update all
packages. Composer will always try to install the newest packages that
match the defined version constraints.

.. note::

    Be careful with that. This command may cause negative effects if you
    do not have proper version constraints in your :file:`composer.json`.
    You always should prefer to update your packages separately.

Update Single Packages
----------------------

When you want to update single packages, you can call `composer update`
with the package name. You should always add
``--with-all-dependencies`` attribute to also update the required third
party packages.

Update TYPO3 Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Update all system extensions::

    composer update typo3/cms-* --with-all-dependencies

Update Extensions Like "news"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    composer update georgringer/news --with-all-dependencies

Use Dev Requirements
====================

Add packages with ``--dev`` attribute to add packages only to your local
development environment. This is very useful for packages, you do not
need or do not want to have on your live server, e.g. PHPUnit or
Testing-Frameworks:

::

    composer require typo3/testing-framework:^2.0 --dev

During your deployment routine, you should run ``composer install`` with
attribute ``--no-dev``. So the dev requirements are not installed.

::

    composer install --no-dev


.. _composer-remove-extension:

Remove Extensions
=================

You can use the composer command `remove` to uninstall extensions or
other composer packages.

::

    composer remove georgringer/news

Don't forget to commit your updated :file:`composer.lock` to your version
control system.

.. note::

    Please be sure to disable extensions in TYPO3's Extension Manager, before removing them with `composer`.
    Or ensure to regenerate your :file:`typo3conf/PackageStates.php` file automatically, after removing the packages. You could use the
    `extension "typo3_console" <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/typo3_console/CommandReference/Index.html#install-generatepackagestates>`__ for that



Check for Available Updates
===========================

Run `composer outdated` to see a list of available updates.

Run `composer outdated -D` to see a list of available updates for directly required packages.

Useful Packages and Bundles
===========================

Simplify "Subtree Split" Installations
--------------------------------------

Instead of explicitly requiring each core extension, you can require
`typo3/minimal <https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/minimal>`__, which
brings the minimal required set of system extensions.

TYPO3 CMS Base Distribution
---------------------------

Primarily, `typo3/cms-base-distribution <https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/cms-base-distribution>`__
is not meant to be used with `composer require`, but to really quickly start new composer based TYPO3 projects.

Nevertheless, it's very good to have heard about it. If you're interested in more information, you should check
the packages `README <https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS.BaseDistribution>`__.

.. _secure-web:

Secure Web
----------

`helhum/typo3-secure-web <https://packagist.org/packages/helhum/typo3-secure-web>`__
follows the very interesting concept to split the traditional web root directory into
two parts: the "public" one for all the resources, that must be directly accessible via
HTTP (images, styles, etc.) - and the "private" folder, where all the PHP will be located.

This helps to make your TYPO3 installations even more secure!
