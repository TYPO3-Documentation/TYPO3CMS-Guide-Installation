Upgrade
=======

When a new version of TYPO3 is released, you should follow the
guideline in this chapter in order to do an upgrade. Also follow any
additional upgrade information carefully. You might e.g. want to skim
the included ChangeLog to see if any features affect the way your site
works. (Look for lines prepended with "!!!" - those are the really
important ones!)

.. note::

   **Version specific upgrade notes**

   While this chapter is a general guideline to follow for a TYPO3
   Upgrade, some :ref:`specific information for upgrading to 7.6
   <upgradeToLts>` is additionally available. Use that as an
   amendment to the general upgrade instructions!

.. note::

   **Think of active users**

   Think of users who might want to do any changes during your upgrading
   and/or fallback. Inform them **before** you start!

Basically these are the steps to be done to update your TYPO3 site:
