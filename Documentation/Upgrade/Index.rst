Upgrade
=======

When a new version of TYPO3 is released, you should follow the
guideline in this chapter in order to do an upgrade. Also follow any
additional upgrade information carefully. You might e.g. want to skim
the `Release Notes on get.typo3.org <https://get.typo3.org/version/10>`_ to
see if any features affect the way your site works.

.. note::

   **Think of active users**

   Think of users who might want to do any changes during your upgrading
   and/or fallback. Inform them **before** you start!

Basically these are the steps to be done to update your TYPO3 site:
