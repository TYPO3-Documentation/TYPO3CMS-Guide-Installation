Upgrade
-------

When a new version of TYPO3 arrives, you should always follow any
additional upgrade information carefully. You might also need to skim
the included ChangeLog to see if any features affect the way your site
works. (Look for lines prepended with "!!!" - those are the really
important ones!)

Basically these steps are involved in updating your TYPO3 site:
