Check the ChangeLog and NEWS.md
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Look through the :file:`ChangeLog` and the :file:`NEWS.md` files in your extracted TYPO3
package. They contain information about new functions you might need or
be interested in.

Especially pay attention to lines starting with "!!!". They are
especially important, because they are about changes that may affect
the operation of some websites.
