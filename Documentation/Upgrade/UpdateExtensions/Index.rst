Update Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Backend, go to the extension manager and update the extensions
you use. TYPO3 CMS stores a reference list of available extensions locally, 
so make sure that the list is up-to-date by clicking the "Update now" button 
in the "Get extensions" view.

You can also take this opportunity to delete all unused extensions, thereby 
making sure that there are no potential security "holes" in files stored on your server.
