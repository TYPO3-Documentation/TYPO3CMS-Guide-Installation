Remove temporary cache files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In typo3temp/Cache/Code/cache_core you will most likely find files
named :file:`ext_localconf_*.php` or :file:`ext_tables_*.php`. These files
must be removed as well.

Go to "Important actions" and click "Clear all cache":

   :alt: The option "Clear all Cache" in the Install Tool.

This method will remove all files from the folder
:file:`typo3temp/Cache/Code/cache_core/`.

Additionally, after an upgrade to a new major version, you should also
delete the other temporary files, which TYPO3 saves in :file:`typo3temp/`. In
the Install Tool go to "Clean up" to do so.
