=========================
Convert global Extensions
=========================

If you use global extensions, convert them to local ones.

Global extensions used to be saved in folders inside
:file:`typo3/ext/`, such as :file:`typo3/ext/news`. In current
versions of TYPO3, this location should no longer be used. Instead,
use local extensions below :file:`typo3conf/ext/`.

To convert a global extension to a local one, do the following:

* Go to the Extension Manager.
* Uninstall the global extension.
* Delete the files of the extension from :file:`typo3/ext/`, including
  the directory of that extension itself.
* Reinstall the extension from TER, which will put it into
  :file:`typo3conf/ext/`.


.. note::

   In earlier versions of TYPO3 global extensions were an easy way of sharing
   extensions between multiple TYPO3 instances. Nowadays the recommended way of
   installing and maintaining extensions is via composer, where you may use
   different strategies to achieve the same goal. One example would be to use
   `"path repositories" <https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path>`__
   in your composer.json file
