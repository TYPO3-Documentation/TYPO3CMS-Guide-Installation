3: Use the upgrade wizard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enter the Install Tool at '.../typo3/install/' on your TYPO3 site.

(If you have password/access problems, please see the section about
the Install Tool in this document).

|img-14| TYPO3 provides an upgrade wizard for easy upgrading. Go to the
"Upgrade Wizard" section and take a look at the different wizards
provided. You should start by using the "Version Compatibility"
wizard, which sets the compatibility version of your TYPO3
installation to the new version. Afterwards you will get redirected to
the next wizard. Please note that some wizards provide optional
features, like installing system extension (for example simulate
static or open docs) that you may not need in your current
installation, so take care to only use the wizards needed.
