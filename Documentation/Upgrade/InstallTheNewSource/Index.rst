Install the New Source
======================

.. note::

   The recommended installation of TYPO3 is based on composer.


Upgrading a Composer Based System
=================================

.. caution::

   TYPO3 v9 LTS has no support for the package `typo3/cms` anymore - instead
   all TYPO3 system extensions are now single packages. When upgrading, remove
   the `typo3/cms` package and require the single packages you need. To make
   selecting the packages easier, you can use
   https://get.typo3.org/misc/composer/helper to find the packages you need.

Use composer to update your system via for example `composer require
typo3/cms-backend:^9.5 typo3/cms-core:^9.5 typo3/cms-extbase:^9.5
typo3/cms-extensionmanager:^9.5 typo3/cms-filelist:^9.5 typo3/cms-fluid:^9.5
typo3/cms-frontend:^9.5 typo3/cms-install:^9.5 typo3/cms-recordlist:^9.5
--update-with-dependencies`

.. note::

   If you get a RuntimeException like `/web/typo3/sysext/core does not exist and
   could not be created.` make sure you have deleted the symlinks from your TYPO3 8
   composer installation `typo3 -> ../vendor/typo3/cms/typo3` and
   `index.php -> ../vendor/typo3/cms/index.php`

If you have extensions installed, you will have to find the corresponding newer
versions you want to install for your new major version and update them, too.

Example:

.. code-block:: shell

   composer require typo3/cms-backend:^9.5 typo3/cms-core:^9.5 \
      typo3/cms-extbase:^9.5 typo3/cms-extensionmanager:^9.5 \
      typo3/cms-filelist:^9.5 typo3/cms-fluid:^9.5 typo3/cms-frontend:^9.5 \
      typo3/cms-install:^9.5 typo3/cms-recordlist:^9.5 georgringer/news:^7.0 \
      --update-with-dependencies

To find the matching extension versions you can go to `packagist.org
<https://packagist.org/>`_, search for your extension and take a look at the
requires section.

.. tip::

   The list of system extensions developed directly in the TYPO3 core repository
   changes from time to time: Some extensions are merged into others, new system extensions
   are added and others abandoned or released to the public and therefore maintained at a
   different place.
   If you want to know details, you can have a look at this `list
   <https://docs.typo3.org/Home/SystemExtensions.html>`_ or search in the
   `breaking changes <https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/Index.html>`_
   for the extension key (not the package name!).

.. _install-next-step:
.. _install-core-updater:

Using the Core Updater
======================

The Install Tool in the section "Important Actions" provides a function to
update the TYPO3 Core.

In the section "Important Actions" scroll down to "Core update" and click the
"Check for core updates" button. If the requirements are met, TYPO3 will
automatically install the new source code.

.. note::

   For the Core Updater to work, the following setup is required:

   * It only works under Unix and MacOS.

   * :file:`typo3_src` must be a symlink.

   * This symlink needs to be writable (and deletable) by the web server user.

   * document root needs to be writable.

   * One path above document root (:file:`../`) needs to be writable (new
     directories need to be allowed to be created).

   * The :program:`tar` command must be available for extracting the Source
     package.

.. note::

   **Disabling the Core Updater**

   The Core Updater functionality can be disabled (in order to avoid users
   using it, i.e. if you use your own update mechanism). To disable the
   core updater, you can set this environment variable::

      TYPO3_DISABLE_CORE_UPDATER=1

   For example in Apache::

      SetEnv TYPO3_DISABLE_CORE_UPDATER 1

   or for nginx::

      server {
        location ~ path/to/it {
          include fastcgi_params;
          fastcgi_param TYPO3_DISABLE_CORE_UPDATER "1";
        }
      }

   This will disable the button and all related functionality in the Install
   Tool.



.. _install-manually:

Installing the Source Manually
==============================

Go to https://typo3.org/download/ and download
the Source package of the new TYPO3 version.

Extract the package on your web server and - in your TYPO3 document root -
adjust the :file:`typo3_src` symlink.


What's the Next Step?
=====================

In case you did a *minor update*, e.g. from TYPO3 9.5.0 to 9.5.1, database
updates are usually *not* necessary. All you still have to do is to
:ref:`remove the temporary cache files <remove-temporary-cache-files>`. After
that your update is finished.

.. note::

   Make sure to read the release notes even of minor versions carefully. While
   we take great care to keep the minor updates as easy as possible especially
   when releasing security updates more steps might be necessary.

In case of a *major update*, e.g. from TYPO3 8.7 to 9.5, go ahead with the next
step!

Also check out the breaking changes listed in `Changelog
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/>`_ for the new version.
