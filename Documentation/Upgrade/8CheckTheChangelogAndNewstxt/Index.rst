8: Check the ChangeLog and NEWS.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Look through the ChangeLog and the NEWS.txt file in your TYPO3 root
folder. It is a good place to get an idea about new functions you
might need or be interested in.

Especially pay attention to the lines starting with "!!!". They are
important, because they are about changes that may affect the
operation of some websites.
