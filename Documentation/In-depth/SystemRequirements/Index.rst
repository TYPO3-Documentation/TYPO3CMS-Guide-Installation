===================
System Requirements
===================

TYPO3 requires a web server, PHP and a database system.

* TYPO3 requires a web server which can run PHP (e.g. Apache, Nginx or IIS).

* TYPO3 10 requires at least PHP 7.2.x (Mac users: see warning: :ref:`php-73-pcre-mac`)

* TYPO3 can be used with a great many database systems (e.g. MySQL or
  Postgres). If you use MySQL, you will need to install at least MySQL 5.5. and maximum MySQL 5.7

If you use an Apache web server, the module mod_rewrite must be activated.
Certain PHP extensions are necessary, others recommended. You possibly want to
adjust the memory limit; see below.

If you want TYPO3 to automatically carry out image processing – for example
scaling or cropping – you will need GraphicsMagick (version 1.3 or newer) or ImageMagick (version 6 or
newer) installed on the server. (GraphicsMagick should be prefered.)

For an overview see also `get.typo3.org
<https://get.typo3.org/version/9#system-requirements>`_.

Should you encounter problems, the ":ref:`troubleshooting`" section at the end
of this document will help.


Database Environment
====================

TYPO3 works with database management systems in the above mentioned versions.
The InnoDB engine is required to be enabled in MySQL.


Required Database Privileges
----------------------------

The database user needs at least the following privileges on the TYPO3
database:

* SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

* CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES

It is recommended to also grant the following privileges:

* CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW

* EXECUTE, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE


Web Server Environment
======================

.. _system-requirements-apache:

Apache
------

* Make sure `AllowOverride <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#allowoverride>`__
  in the webserver configuration includes "Indexes" and "FileInfo" if you use Apache as
  webserver and override the default configuration with :file:`.htaccess` (as done by default).

* Enable Apache modules (see :ref:`enable-necessary-modules` in the Troubleshooting
  section). The following modules are used by the default :file:`.htaccess`:

mod_alias:
    Block access to vcs directories
    (strongly recommended for security reasons).

mod_authz_core:
    Block access to specific files and directories
    (strongly recommended for security reasons).

mod_autoindex:
    Used for disabling directory listings
    (strongly recommended for security reasons).

mod_deflate:
    Used for compression, better performance.

mod_expires:
    Adds HTTP headers for browser caching and better
    performance

mod_filter:
    Used with mod_deflate. For Apache versions below
    version 2.3.7 you don't need to enable `mod_filter`.

mod_headers:
    Used in combination with `mod_deflate`.

mod_rewrite:
    Enable human readable urls.

mod_setenvif:
    Also used with `mod_deflate`.

.. important::

    If the modules are not active, the corresponding directives in :file:`.htaccess` will
    not be activated (due to the `<IfModule` conditions). This leaves you with a system,
    which is less secure, slower and / or where some things will simply not work
    (e.g. URL rewriting due to missing `mod_rewrite`).

.. tip::

   Look for `<IfModule>` directives in the default :file:`.htaccess` file
   `EXT:install/Resources/Private/FolderStructureTemplateFiles/root-htaccess <https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/blob/master/typo3/sysext/install/Resources/Private/FolderStructureTemplateFiles/root-htaccess>`__
   for more clues about which modules are used for what purpose. Not all used modules
   may have directives in the .htaccess file so do not necessarily expect :file:`.htaccess`
   to contain a complete list of modules.

* During the installation process (first install) the default :file:`.htaccess` file is
  copied to the document root folder of the project, if the file does not exist already.


Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)
---------------------------------------------

* During the installation process (first install) the default IIS web config file is
  copied to the document root folder of the project, if the file does not exist already.

* Default IIS web config file with rewrite rules can be found in
  :file:`EXT:install/Resources/Private/FolderStructureTemplateFiles/root-web-config`

NGINX
-----

* NGINX web server does not support any static file like htaccess in the document root by default.
  The NGINX configuration has to be setup manually.

* Examples of NGINX vHost config files with rewrite rules can be found in
  TYPO3 Forge. `Provide a Nginx server configuration <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/54316>`__.


PHP Environment
---------------

* memory_limit set to at least 256M recommended

* max_execution_time set to at least 30 (240 seconds recommended)

* max_input_vars set to at least 1500


PHP Required Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your PHP needs to support the following extensions. Install will check if these
are available.

* These are usually part of the standard PHP package on most distributions:

  * PDO
  * json
  * pcre >= 8.38 (Mac users: see warning a the end of this document)
  * session
  * xml
  * filter
  * hash
  * mbstring
  * SPL
  * standard

* These might have to be installed separately:

  * fileinfo
  * gd
  * zip
  * zlib
  * openssl
  * intl
  * mysqli (if you use MySQL, MariaDB as DBMS)
  * postgresql (if you use PostgreSQL as DBMS)
  * sqlsrv (if you use SQL Server as DBMS)
  * sqlite (if you use SQLite as DBMS)
