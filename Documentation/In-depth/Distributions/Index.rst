=================
The Distributions
=================

Distributions were created to give new users easy access to a
preconfigured installation of TYPO3 that they could then use without the
need to set up and configure various parts of the CMS such as page
structure, content and templating.

.. tip::

   The following is only true, if you installed TYPO3 without Composer:

   When installing TYPO3 for the first time, you will be given the option to
   access a set of "Preconfigured Distributions" once the installation is complete.
   Upon selecting this option, you will be redirected to your installations "Extension Manger"
   and given a list of Distributions to choose from.

   For an existing installation of TYPO3, distributions are already available and
   can be accessed in the Extension Manager.

.. note::

   If you installed TYPO3 via Composer, all extensions and distributions
   will need to be installed and managed via Composer.


.. _introduction-package:

Introduction Package
====================

The Introduction Package is a complete, fully operational website. It it based on a
responsive design using bootstrap templates and contains example
content for testing and evaluation. This is ideal for new users who wish
to have a "look around" and get more familiar with the CMS.

   The Introduction Package provides a fully operational website based on bootstrap.


To install the introduction package, follow the instructions in :ref:`install-introduction-package`.

.. important::

   The steps for installing a distribution with Composer are the same as
   installing an extension with Composer. See the section
   :ref:`install-extension-with-composer` if you wish to install additional
   extensions. You can also find more information in that section.
