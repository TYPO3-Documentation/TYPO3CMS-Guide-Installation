The Distributions
=================

Several Distributions are available for TYPO3 for use in your installation. In
essence, a Distribution is an extension which sets up and configures TYPO3 to
get you started. A Distribution often creates an example page structure and
content elements, as well as automatically handling the installation and
activation of useful extensions like `RealURL
<https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/realurl/>`__.

If you selected the option to load preconfigured Distributions during the final
step of the installation process (in the Install Tool), you will be redirected
to the "Get preconfigured distribution" screen of the Extension Manager after
logging in to the backend. You can also navigate there manually, of course.

.. note::

   If you installed TYPO3 via composer all extension downloads as well as
   distribution installations have to be done via composer command line, too.


Amongst non-core options, the following Core Distribution is available:

.. _introduction-package:

Introduction Package
====================

The Introduction Package is a complete demo website. It it based on a
responsive design using bootstrap templates and contains a lot of default
content for testing and learning. Try this one if you are new to TYPO3.

   The Introduction Package provides a full website based on bootstrap.

Installing Distributions without composer
=========================================

For testing and learning we recommend that you use the Introduction Package,
but several other distributions are available.

Move to the **ADMIN TOOLS > Extensions** module and choose
"Get preconfigured distribution" from the menu in the docheader.
Just choose the Distribution you would like to use and hit the "Install"
button.

If you want to build your web site from scratch, just go ahead *without*
using a Distribution. You can then start with a completely empty
installation of TYPO3.


Installing Distributions with composer
======================================

To install the introduction package or any other distribution on a composer
based installation use `composer require typo3/cms-introduction` (change
the package name to the distribution you want). Afterwards use the
following commands to activate the extension(s) via command line:

.. code-block:: shell

   .vendor/bin/typo3 extensionmanager:extension:install bootstrap_package
   ./vendor/bin/typo3 extensionmanager:extension:install introduction

In this case, the introduction package depends on the bootstrap_package, so
both packages have to be installed.

On Windows: Use use :file:`.\vendor\bin\typo3.bat` instead.
