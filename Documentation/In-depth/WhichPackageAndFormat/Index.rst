Which Package and which Format?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended to install TYPO3 via the PHP package manager `composer`.
See :ref:`install-via-composer`. If you are not able to use composer for
your project, download the source package from `get.typo3.org <https://get.typo3.org/>`_.

Which File Format to use
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The TYPO3 Source package is available as a :file:`.zip` or
:file:`.tar.gz` distribution. Their content is the same and you should
download the one that you will be able to extract directly on your
web server (Windows based systems are more likely to use the :file:`.zip`
file while Linux distributions tend to use the :file:`.tar.gz` file).
