Which Package and which Format?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The recommended way of installing TYPO3 is via the PHP package manager `Composer`.
For detailed instructions on how to install TYPO3 using Composer, visit the
:ref:`install-via-composer`section of this manual.

If you do not have access to Composer, you can install TYPO3 by downloading
and then extracting its source package on your web server. TYPO3's source package
can be found here: `https://get.typo3.org <https://get.typo3.org>`_.

Which File Format to use
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The TYPO3 Source package is available as a :file:`.zip` or
:file:`.tar.gz` distribution. Their content is the same and you should
download the one that you will be able to extract directly on your
web server (Windows based systems are more likely to use the :file:`.zip`
file while Linux distributions tend to use the :file:`.tar.gz` file.
