Translating the Backend
=======================

In order to use translations in the TYPO3 Backend, you first need to download
the translations and then select them for the Backend users.


.. _download-translations-for-the-backend:

Download Translations for the Backend
=====================================

Log in to the Backend and go to the Backend module "Maintenance".

In the section "Manage Language Packs" click "Manage Languages". In the modal
window click "Add Language" to add a new language to TYPO3.

After that click "Update all" to update the translations. This may take some
time. Some extensions do not have translatable texts and so also do not have
translations available. If for an extension you get an error message, wait
until the update has finished and then press "Update from repository" again.

.. hint::

   After installing new extensions, you'll have to update the language packs
   again to get translations for the newly installed packages.


.. _change-the-language-for-a-backend-user:

Change the Language for a Backend User
======================================

The Backend can be displayed in different languages for different users. Go to
the module "User settings". On the tab "Personal data" you can choose between
the languages, which you downloaded in the last step. Select the language,
which you want to use. Then click "Save Configuration" and after that reload
the Backend.

When you are logged in as an administrator, you can also modify user settings
of *other* users: Go to the module "Backend Users" and switch to the Backend
user, which you want to edit. After that you can set user settings for this
user and adjust *his/her* language as well.
