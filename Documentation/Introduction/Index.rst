About this Document
===================

This manual provides instructions on how to install and
also upgrade an existing TYPO3 CMS installation.

The "Installation" section is aimed at beginners who want to set up
a new installation of TYPO3 CMS. The "Update" section targets
those who already have a running website and wish to upgrade it
to a newer version of TYPO3 CMS.

It is recommended that you follow each of the steps in the "Quick Installation"
section in order to ensure that your installation is completed correctly. After
this point you may wish to take a closer a look at the "In-Depth Installation" section
to find out how to further configure and customize your installation of TYPO3.
