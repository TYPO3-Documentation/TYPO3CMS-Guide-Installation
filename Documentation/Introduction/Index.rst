About this document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This manual gives you an introduction on how to install or
upgrade your TYPO3 CMS installation.

The "Installation" section is aimed at beginners who want to get
a fresh TYPO3 CMS website up and running. The "Update" section targets
those who already have a running website and want to migrate it
to a newer version of TYPO3 CMS.

You *must* go through the steps in the section "Quick Installation" in
order to get your TYPO3 installation up and running. During or after
that, you have the option go through the section "In-Depth Installation" to
configure TYPO3 in more detail.
