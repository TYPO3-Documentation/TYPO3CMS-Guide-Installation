Troubleshooting
---------------

The following sections contain hints to help you solve common problems.
Note that you should also check the section "System Environment" in the
Install Tool, in which TYPO3 will inform you about errors and warnings
in your installation which might influence performance.
Follow the advice given there to fix those issues. This helps to
solve or prevent most issues.

During troubleshooting, in the "Configuration Presets" section of the Install
Tool, under "Debug settings", you should select the "Debug" preset. This is
especially helpful, if e.g. in the Frontend you only see a blank page. With
debug settings activated, the PHP error message will be displayed, which will
help you narrow down the problem.
