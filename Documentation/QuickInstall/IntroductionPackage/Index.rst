Install Introduction Package
============================

.. hint::

   The Introduction Package creates a demo website! If you do not want
   that, skip this page and proceed to :ref:`install-next-steps`.

If you are using TYPO3 for the first time you may want to
see a working example of the CMS before you start work on
your own project.

The `Official Introduction Package
<https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/introduction/>`__ showcases many of
TYPO3's capabilities and gives you the ability to try them first hand.
The Introduction Package utilizes the `bootstrap_package extension
<https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/bootstrap_package/>`__
to generate multiple responsive HTML templates that you can select and try
out.

It also features examples of the different kinds page content that you
typically see on a website. Such as paragraphs of text, images, tables
and navigation menus.

Find more information in :ref:`introduction-package`.

.. _installing-distributions-wit-composer:

If you installed TYPO3 with Composer
====================================

To install the Introduction Package or any other distribution on a Composer
based installation use:

.. code-block:: shell

   composer require typo3/cms-introduction


Use the following commands to activate the extension(s) via the command line:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./vendor/bin/typo3 extension:activate bootstrap_package
   ./vendor/bin/typo3 extension:activate introduction

In this case, the Introduction Package depends on the Bootstrap Package
(extension key: `bootstrap_package`), so both packages have to be activated.

When done, proceed with :ref:`install-intro-first-steps`.
