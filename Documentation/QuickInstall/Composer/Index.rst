Install TYPO3 via composer
==========================

.. attention::

   The recommended way of installing TYPO3 is via composer.


To create a new TYPO3 project use the TYPO3 Base Distribution::

	# Download the Base Distribution, the latest "stable" release (9.5)
	composer create-project typo3/cms-base-distribution YourNewProjectFolder

.. note::

   To install TYPO3 via composer on windows composer should be started as admin
   or explicitly given the right to create symlinks (use for example a
   powershell or git bash started with admin rights).

After composer finishes, you should have the following folder structure:

.. figure:: ../../Images/folder-structure-composer.png
   :class: with-shadow
   :alt: Folder Structure

   The folder structure after composer installation.


Point the document root of your web server to the `public` folder.

After composer installation continue with the steps in :ref:`the-install-tool`

If you do not want to use composer, follow the :ref:`package installation
guide`.
