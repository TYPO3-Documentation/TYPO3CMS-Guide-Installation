After the basic installation procedure is complete, TYPO3 will be working and
the most appropriate settings will have been made for you. You will get
redirected to the Backend and can log in with your administrator account.

If you want to make changes to your installation settings at a later date, use
the "Admin Tools" in the backend. You can find more information in the section
"In-Depth Installation", subsection ":ref:`the-install-tool-in-depth`".
