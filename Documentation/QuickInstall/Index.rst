==================
Quick Installation
==================

For those already familiar with running web software, get started quickly with

section :ref:`in-depth-installation`.

The following instructions assume you are able to create symlinks on the target
machine (which needs elevated permissions on Windows machines).

**Installation steps:**

1. Checkout out the system requirements

   Install required software, such as:

   * Web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS...)
   * PHP â‰¥ 7.2
   * Database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB ...)
   * ... more see :ref:`system-requirements`

2. Install the TYPO3 core

   This can be done either using the package manager Composer or by unpacking
   a downloaded archive. Using Composer is the recommended way to install TYPO3.

   The installation steps are described in the subchapters:

   * :ref:`install-via-composer`
   * **or** :ref:`install-typo3-without-composer`

3. "Admin Tool"

   Once the source is installed, you must walk through the "Admin Tool" (formerly called
   "Install Tool"). This is described in:

   * :ref:`the-install-tool`
