Installing TYPO3
================

For those already familiar with running web software, get started quickly with
this quick install guide. For a more detailed description, take a look at the
section :ref:`in-depth-installation`.

The following instructions assume you are able to create symlinks on the target
machine (which needs elevated permissions on Windows machines).

1. Checkout out the system requirements

   Install required software, such as:

   * Web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS...)
   * PHP â‰¥ 7.2
   * Database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB ...)
   * ... more see :ref:`system-requirements`

   .. tip::
      Alternatively, you can use a container solution such as
      `DDEV <https://www.ddev.com/get-started/>`__ which comes with preconfigured
      configuration for TYPO3.

2. Install the TYPO3 core

   This can be done either using the package manager Composer or by unpacking
   a downloaded archive. Using Composer is the recommended way to install TYPO3.

   The installation steps are described in the subchapters:

   * :ref:`install-via-composer`
   * **or** :ref:`install-typo3-without-composer`

3. "Admin Tool"

   Once the source is installed, you must walk through the "Admin Tool" (formerly called
   "Install Tool"). This is described in:

   * :ref:`the-install-tool`

4. Install "Introduction Package" (optional)

   This is recommended if you wish to create a TYPO3 demo site.

   * :ref:`install-introduction-package`
