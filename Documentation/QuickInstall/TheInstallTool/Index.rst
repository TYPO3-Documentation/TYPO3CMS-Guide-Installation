The Install Tool
================

#. Hit the start page of your freshly created site with your browser
   and the Install Tool will open in the so called "1-2-3 mode".
   It will guide you through the steps for installing TYPO3. (The
   Install Tool is located in 'typo3/install' in your installation,
   e.g.
   :samp:`https://example.org/typo3/install/`.)

.. note::
    If you can't access 'typo3/install' use the full install URL: 'typo3/sysext/install/Start/Install.php'

#. This is what you should see:

#. In case you have problems in your Environment, you will get warnings
   or hints in this screen. In this case, you should try to fix them;
   the ":ref:`troubleshooting`" section might help you.

#. *Enter your database credentials.* Enter MySQL username and password.
   In most cases the type is "Socket Based Connection".

#. *Create a new database for TYPO3 or use an existing empty
   database.*

      :alt: Install Tool, third step.

#. Enter a username and password for your first TYPO3 admin user. (For security 
   reasons, it's best not to use the name *admin*.) This
   password will also be configured for the Install Tool. The "site
   name" will identify this installation (in the page tree and browser
   title).

#. In the last step you can decide to download a list of distributions (pre-configured sites), or to create a
   base empty page, or just start with an empty installation.

#. **The basic installation is now complete!**

After the basic installation procedure is complete, TYPO3 will be working
and the most appropriate settings will have been made for you. You
will get redirected to the Backend and can log in with your admin user account.

If you want to make changes to your installation settings at a later date,
use the "Install Tool". You can find more information in the section
"In-Depth Installation", subsection ":ref:`the-install-tool-in-depth`"
below.
