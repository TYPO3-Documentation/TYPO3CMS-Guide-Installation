The Install Tool
================

#. Hit the start page of your freshly created site with your browser
   and you should see the "thank you for downloading"-message.

      Success message after download.

#. Create the file FIRST_INSTALL in your web root directory and reload
   the page. You will be redirected to the install tool.
   It will guide you through the steps for installing TYPO3. The
   Install Tool is located in 'typo3/install' in your installation
   which for example would be
   :samp:`https://example.org/typo3/install/`.

#. This is what you should see:

      Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, first step.

#. In case you have problems in your Environment, you will get warnings
   or hints in this screen. In this case, you should try to fix them;
   the ":ref:`troubleshooting`" section might help you.

#. *Enter your database credentials.* Enter MySQL username and password.
   In most cases the database host is "localhost".

      Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, third step.

#. Enter a username and password for your first TYPO3 admin user. (For security
   reasons, it's best not to use the name *admin*.) This
   password will also be configured for the Install Tool. The "site
   name" will identify this installation (in the page tree and browser
   title).

      :class: with-shadow

      Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, forth step.

#. In the last step you can choose whether you want to start with an
   empty TYPO3 or if you want to have a basis to start from.

      :alt: fifth step
      :class: with-shadow

      Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, fifth step.

#. **The basic installation is now complete!**

After the basic installation procedure is complete, TYPO3 will be working
and the most appropriate settings will have been made for you. You
will get redirected to the Backend and can log in with your admin user account.

If you want to make changes to your installation settings at a later date,
use the "Install Tool". You can find more information in the section
"In-Depth Installation", subsection ":ref:`the-install-tool-in-depth`"
below.
